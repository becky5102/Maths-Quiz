## Work Experience
for my work experience , I was given a use case and 5 days to make
a programme which would give the customer the programme they wanted.
The use case was to make a Primary maths quiz
The programme need to have :
        * 20 random questions
        * a 2 minute timer to answer them it
        * the ability to change the difficulty of the questions
        * the programme needed to be able to mark each answer to give
        the students a final score
        * this final score along with the students name and class(school)
        need to be able to be inputted into a scoreboard (database)
        * this scoreboard also need to hold previous quiz scores

On first look the project seem quite straight forward but once I began
looking at the use case in further detail and notices that there is a lot of
missing pieces of information. For example it only stated that he
(the customer)is a primary school maths teacher but children in primary can aged
from 4-11 which would have a big impacted on their maths ability. Also people
have different maths ability so everyone having the same questions would have it
too easy for some people but for other it would be too difficult.

At the beginning , it was rather  difficult as I only know python and bits of
SQL and the program we were writing it in was Typescript and HTML. This was a
real struggle at the beginning and a lot of google searching helps a bit but
what help the most was the guidance I got off the company which really helped
me get started in a new language.

During the programming , there were frustrating moments when it just would not
work and many google searches didn't help but it was always sort with the help
of my mentor . But there was also moment when everything perfectly fell into
place and all of a sudden , other problem could be fixed and it just clicked
and I knew what I needed to do. Even though there was bits of frustration , I
wouldn't change any of it as it helped a lot with learning the language and even
if it didn't solve problem A it would help solve problem B . Also if it wasn't
challenging it would become rather bored very quickly and would ruin how good
of a moment it is when everything finally works with any problems or errors.

At the end of my experience , I have learn parts of a new language (typescript)
and a mark-up language(HTML) and how to upload programmes to git bash and
firebase . I am sure that these need skills will help me in the future and it
has also given me experience of what it would be like to work for a programming
company.

I'm pleased with the programme I have created in 5 days and would do it all
again in a heart beat . It was excited , enjoyable , creative , challenging and
at times it is so funny  like it situation when the only thing stopping the
programme is a full stop in the wrong place or a missing bracket. I have also
loved the amazing , supporting , friendly atmosphere in the company everyday
which truly makes this experience so much better.

If I was to improved my programme , I would:
          1). Try using more bootstrap to make the user UI look a lot more
          interesting and more colourful for children.
          2).I would also try and make an external database (using a local one)
          so the information will be kept longer.
          3).try using new functions to see if it can improve the programme or
          find new ways to take 20 lines of code into 3-4 lines with it still
          working in the same way or a better way.

I would also like to try making other similar programmes to learn the language
(typescript) a lot more as I believe it will be valuable in the future.
